# iCompressor-An-Android-Application
iCompressor is an android application developed and submitted as university project for "System analysis and design" course. It has two compressing options. First one is image compression and second one is video compression. The application is very user friendly and light. User can choose the quality of the compression of the selected files and also may choose to delete the original files. For storing the compressed files it has a default location but it is also changeable. Lastly It was developed while i was still learning android so it may not be good enough for people to use but it was enough well-developed to get me A+ . :D Happy Coding .
